# Abstract

"The Queen's Christmas Broadcast," is an annual started by King George V in 1932 and continued by Queen Elizabeth II throughout her reign. Although the landscape of the British Empire has shifted and there have been several challenges to the monarchy’s prestige, the annual message is firmly a bedrock to stability and connection for the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. 

Through data analysis with tools in the Python environment, the study investigates the message and language usage with the Broadcast to test if it adapts to global events or if the message remains the same. The research and methodology use tools developed in class to analyze the Queen’s broadcasts. The challenges of this research were the limits on the available tools and access permissions on the source data. Web scraping, data cleaning, and text analysis were incorporated into analyzing the data. 

The research asserts that Queen Elizabeth strove for positivity and used consistently positive language even during periods of hardship. The absence of elevated vocabulary suggests an effort on behalf of the Queen to connect with her public, framing the British Empire as a community rather than subjects under a sovereign.
